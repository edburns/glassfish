## How to Contribute to GlassFish and Java EE

There are many ways to contribute to GlassFish and to the larger Java EE ecosystem.

### Participate in the GlassFish Community

Being involved in the GlassFish Community is probably the easiest way. For example, you can help your peers in the [GlassFish Mailing List](https://javaee.groups.io/g/glassfish).

### Adopt-a-JSR

Adopt-a-JSR is an initiative lead by JUG leaders to encourage JUG members to get involved in a JSR, to evangelize that JSR to their JUG and the wider Java community, in order to increase grass roots participation.  
More information can be found on the [Adopt-a-JSR for Java EE](https://community.oracle.com/community/java/jcp/adopt-a-jsr) page.

### Contribute code to GlassFish

If you are a developer interested in contributing to the GlassFish project, here are a few things you should probably know.  


#### - Build GlassFish

Starting with GlassFish v3, the build infrastructure is entirely based on Maven.  


#### - Contribute Code

Contributing to GlassFish can be done in various ways: fixing bugs, enhancements, new features, or even whole modules. If you want to raise a Pull Request with your changes, please refer to [GlassFish Pull Request Acceptance Workflow](glassfish-pullrequest.md).


#### - Test GlassFish

There are several different tests that are currently available in GlassFish. QuickLook tests run in a short time and cover a broad set of the application server features. Developer tests are also available for the different modules. Each module has more information about running those tests.  

### Contribute Samples

We also welcome good quality samples that demonstrate a specific feature of GlassFish or a specific Java EE API. Samples combining mutliple Java EE APIs are also useful.
