In a private email conversation, btrace author, Sundar ( <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/sundararajan/">http://blogs.oracle.com/sundararajan/</a> <p>), has confirmed that a JMX cover is being planned. He says: /BTrace author can annotate a bit more in trace class so that the trace class registers itself as a MXBean. Specially annotated fields will be exposed as MXBean attributes.

         <td class="confluenceTd"> section #4.1.1.15: It says /Also, the set of operations that a Btrace client can perform is also limited./ It is fairly simple to relax BTrace strictness. Sundar says they need to change BTrace code in just two places. If desired, we can allow restricted method calls (say calls to specific Sun classes only). How to write higher level probes (rather than trace author using internal code names which would be unstable) using btrace? It is given below: /BTrace allows one or more probe descriptors be written. The probe descriptors map abstract provide/probe name to concrete class/method (or some other concrete probes). This way trace author can write trace code that is "stable". For example, see "$BTRACE/samples/SocketTracker1.java". The probe descriptor file is $BTRACE/samples/java.net.Socket.xml This file maps JDK's internal class/method names to higher level provide/probe names. This method is better compared to doing code changes to traced code. i.e., DTrace expects traced program authors to insert macros in their code. While that approach is okay for C/C++ world, for java world any code change in traced program just for observability is undesirable. Even a simple "event out" method will be a cost. The XML mapping scheme removes that disadvantage. You may want probe points at specific locations which may not be expressible as BTrace probe points. Even in such cases it is possible to call an empty static method from a class – which can be instrumented by BTrace. The empty methods are inlined and optimized away by hotspot and other VMs anyway. (whereas event firing methods may not optimized that way). </td>
