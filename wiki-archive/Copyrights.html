The comment should use the syntax appropriate for the type of file. For example, .java files will use Java syntax comments, XML files will use XML syntax comments, and so on. See below for examples in different formats.</p> <h4><a name="Copyrights-Copyrightyears"></a>Copyright years</h4> <p>The copyright notice should include the year the file was created. When a file is updated, the copyright notice should be updated to include the current year as well. Only the first year and last year should be included. A range of years is expressed as two years separated by a dash, with no spaces, e.g., "1997-2010".</p> <h4><a name="Copyrights-Commentformat"></a>Comment format</h4> <p>In general, the comment containing the copyright and license notice should be the first text in the file and should be followed by a blank line. The following exceptions are allowed:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>A shell script may start with a "#!" line.</li> 
      <li>A Python file may have a "# -*- coding:" line after the "#!" line.</li> 
      <li>An XML format file may start with a "&lt;?xml&gt;" line, and may have a "&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;" line before the comment.</li> 
      <li>An html file may have "&lt;html&gt;" and "&lt;head&gt;" lines before the comment.</li> 
     </ul> <h4><a name="Copyrights-TheCommonCase"></a>The Common Case</h2> <p>Source files created by Oracle employees will typically use one of two licenses:</p> 
     <ol> 
      <li>Most source code will use the CDDL and GPL license with the Classpath Exception.</li> 
      <li>Demo or sample source code should use the BSD license.</li> 
     </ol> <p>The copyright/license header should be the first text in the file, with exceptions noted above.</p>

     </div> <h4><a name="Copyrights-ThirdPartyFiles"></a>Third Party Files</h2> <p>Files that are imported from a third party, such as Apache licensed files, are handled differently. (Remember that you <b>always</b> need approval before importing any third-party code, no matter what the license is.) If the file is imported with no changes, or with only minor changes, the original copyright and license must be maintained.</p> <p>The following general rules apply to third-party files:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>Always</b> obtain approval before adding any third-party files to the workspace.</li> 
      <li><b>Never</b> alter or delete a third-party copyright notice, unless explicitly instructed by an Oracle attorney.</li> 
      <li>Never delete other text that appears to claim ownership, unless explicitly instructed by an Oracle attorney. Examples include phrases such as "Property of ..." or "Created by ...".</li> 
      <li>If a third-party file does not contain a third-party copyright notice, do not insert such a notice.</li> 
      <li>If a file contains a third-party copyright notice but no license notice or other statement of permission, and if the license text is in a separate file near the source file, retain the separate file but do not insert that license text into the source file.</li> 
     </ul> <p>When the amount of change in a third-party file is significant, we add the Oracle copyright and license notice to the file while preserving the original copyright and license notice. See below for an example using the Apache license. Note that this approach only works for third-party code that uses a liberal license that allows us to relicense the code under our license. Examples of such licenses are the Apache license, the BSD license, and the MIT license. GPL and similar licenses do <b>not</b> allow this approach. When in doubt, ask for help.</p> <p>How do you tell when the amount of change is significant? The following guidance from the U.S. Copyright office may be helpful if you need to determine whether modifications to a file have transformed that file into a derivative work. To be copyrightable, a derivative work must be different enough from the original to be regarded as a new work or must contain a substantial amount of new material. Making minor changes or additions of little substance to a preexisting work will not qualify the work as a new version for copyright purposes. The new material must be original and copyrightable in itself. Titles, short phrases, and format, for example, are not copyrightable.</p> <p>As always, if in doubt then ask for help.</p> <h4><a name="Copyrights-OtherCases"></a>Other Cases</h2> <p>For any other cases, please contact your manager, your product manager, or <a href="mailto:bill.shannon@oracle.com">Bill Shannon</a> for assistance.</p> <h4><a name="Copyrights-PortionsCopyright"></a>Portions Copyright</h2> <p>If you read the license notice carefully, you'll see that it has instructions for contributors who want to copyright their modifications to a file. In such a case, a separate comment block should be added after the main copyright/license comment block with this additional information in the following format:</p> 
     <div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;">
      <div class="preformattedContent panelContent"> 
       <pre>/*
 * Portions Copyright [year] [name of copyright owner]
 */
</pre> 
      </div>
     </div> <h4><a name="Copyrights-UpdatingAFile"></a>Updating A File</h2> <p>When updating a file, verify that the license header meets the above requirements.<br> Also, ensure that the copyright includes the current year as well as the first year that the file was created; it should be either a single year (e.g., "2010"), or a range of years separated by a dash with no spaces (e.g., "1997-2010").</p> <h4><a name="Copyrights-GeneratedSourceFiles"></a>Generated Source Files</h2> <p>Files generated at build time and shipped only in binary form (including minimized .js files) do <b>not</b> need a license or copyright header.</p> <p>Files generated at build time and shipped in source form <b>do</b> need a copyright and license header.</p> <p>Files generated at run time based on some user code do <b>not</b> need a copyright or license header. (For example, .java files generated for JSP pages, deployment descriptors generated for annotations.)</p> <p>Files generated at run time without depending on any user code <b>do</b> need a copyright and license header. (For example, start/stop scripts, asenv.conf file, domain.xml.)</p> <h4><a name="Copyrights-MavenCopyrightPlugin"></a>Maven Copyright Plugin</h2> <p>You can check that your copyright notices are correct using the Maven copyright plugin in projects<br> that have it configured in the pom.xml:</p> 
     <div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;">
      <div class="preformattedContent panelContent"> 
       <pre>$ mvn glassfish-copyright:copyright
</pre> 
      </div>
     </div> <p>To repair any errors discovered (use this carefully, and check the results):</p> 
     <div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;">
      <div class="preformattedContent panelContent"> 
       <pre>$ mvn glassfish-copyright:repair
</pre> 
      </div>
     </div> <p>The copyright plugin is configured to use a common exclude list in the maven artifact org.glassfish:copyright. If you get complaints about this, you'll need to build this artifact explicitly (it's not built by a normal full build). Use either:</p> 
     <div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;">
      <div class="preformattedContent panelContent"> 
       <pre>$ mvn -Prelease-phase1 install
</pre> 
      </div>
     </div> <p>or</p> 
     <div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;">
      <div class="preformattedContent panelContent"> 
       <pre>$ cd copyright; mvn install
</pre> 
      </div>
     </div> <p>For more information, see the README file at <a href="http://java.net/projects/glassfish/sources/svn/show/trunk/copyright-plugin">http://java.net/projects/glassfish/sources/svn/show/trunk/copyright-plugin</a>.</p> <p>For projects that don't (yet) have the plugin configured in their pom.xml, you can run it using:</p> 
     <div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;">
      <div class="preformattedContent panelContent"> 
       <pre>mvn org.glassfish.copyright:glassfish-copyright-maven-plugin:copyright -Pcopyright
</pre> 
      </div>
     </div> <h4><a name="Copyrights-SampleCopyrightNotices"></a>Sample Copyright Notices</h2> <p>Here's the copyright notice format for .java files (and other files that use the same comment syntax), which <b>must</b> be the first text in the file:</p> 
     <div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;">
      <div class="preformattedContent panelContent">
