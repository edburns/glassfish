1. Introduction
    1.1. Project/Component Working Name:
         Jersey

    1.2. Name(s) and e-mail address of Document Author(s)/Supplier:
         Paul.Sandoz@Sun.Com

    1.3. Date of This Document:	 
         05/21/10

2. Project Summary
    2.1. Project Description:

         Modularization of Jersey distribution to GlassFish.

         Deployment of OSGi-war bundles to GlassFish.

         Update tests and the test framework to use the latest embedded GlassFish API.

         Improved CDI and JAX-RS integration.

         Improved JSON support using Jackson.

         Integrate Jersey with JRebel for RAD.

         Improved hypermedia support on the client and server.

         Add further DTrace probes.

    2.2. Risks and Assumptions:
         
         CDI needs to function correctly for advanced use the Extension SPI.

3. Problem Summary
    3.1. Problem Area:

        Unification of OSGi support in and outside of GlassFish.

        Deployment of multiple versions of Jersey-based applications to GlassFish.

        Better integration with Java EE 6.

        Better and more intuitive JSON support.

        Increase rapid application development.

        Improved ease of use when building hypermedia-based applications.

        Diagnose issues with in-production running JAX-RS applications.

    3.2. Justification:

        Improves the teams efficiency to distribute Jersey to GlassFish.

        Enables developers to use the latest stable version of Jersey when a lesser version
        is installed in GlassFish.

        Smooth integration of Java EE 6 components gives developers a better experience.

        JSON is an important representation format for RESTful applications.

        Hypermedia is a key aspect of RESTful applications.

        Analysis of in-production running JAX-RS applications can help diagnose system performance 
        issues.

4. Technical Description:
     4.1. Details:

Jersey currently ships a jersey bundle to GF (in addition to other 
jars) containing a number of jersey modules. This will be changed so 
that each jersey module is shipped directly and aligns with OSGi support
of Jersey in and outside of GlassFish.

Deployment of Jersey applications to GlassFish as an OSGI-bundle will
enable multiple versions of Jersey to be installed in isolation. 
Currently many developers are having issues with running later versions 
of Jersey to that which is installed in GlassFish. This feature is not 
really Jersey specific but Jersey will provide input to requirements and
will test deployments.
The class loader delegation feature of GlassFish is not sufficient for isolation
because javax.* classes are always delegated to GlassFish. 
The Jersey team will attempt to resolve this issue which may a) require changes 
to the 311 implementation that will affect performance; or b) changes to the 
GlassFish Web app class loader to support non-delegation of javax.ws.rs.* classes.

Jersey currently uses a very old version of the GlassFish embedded 
API. This needs to be updated to use the latest API for embedded tests 
and for use with the jersey test framework.

Jersey needs to improve it's integration with CDI such that the 
optional aspects of the JAX-RS spec in this regard are investigated and 
implemented. Specifically this means providing bindings such @Inject 
works for JAX-RS/Jersey related injection points. 

The JAXB JSON support in Jersey can work for simple cases but 
developers are struggling to understand the how the JSON relates to the 
classes and there are many edge cases that are hard to support because 
of the mismatch between the JSON data model and the XML infoset model 
that JAXB uses. Jackson is an excellent library that provides a clearer 
mapping from POJOs to JSON. Jersey is already depending on it for 
low-level support.

Jersey caches runtime information generated from Java reflection for 
performance reasons. This does not work so well when Jersey developers 
utilize JRebel for rapid development. A Jersey/JRebel plugin will solve 
this. Such a plugin was prototyped over a year ago. This is technically 
feasible and requires that JRebel cause Jersey to reload (a feature 
which Jersey already supports).

Hypermedia support for RESTful application is an important area that 
JAX-RS 1.x left for a future JAX-RS specification.  Jersey can provide 
useful APIs on the client and server that can be input to a future 
JAX-RS specification. These APIs will be public thus it is important to 
get these APIs right before being shipped with a stable release of 
Jersey, hence why these features are closer to the end of the GlassFish 
3.1 release schedule. These APIs will be shipped in the experimental 
area of Jersey and distributed with SNAPSHOTs before becoming part of 
the stable API.

Jersey already has DTrace probe support for resource matching. Such that 
DTrace can be utilized to aggregate information on URIs associated with 
resource classes. Probing can be extended to include interactions with
other JAX-RS components such as MessageBodyReader/Writer selection, 
ExceptionMapper selection and ContextResolver selection, where appropriate.
