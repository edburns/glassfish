     <ul> 
      <li>Attendees: Dies, Anissa, Jennifer, Ken, Nazrul, Bill, Byron, Paul, Tom, ???</li> 
      <li>Today's meeting was a continuance of last week's cluster support discussion.<br> The following will be the same between GF V2 and V3 clustering:</li> 
     </ul> 
     <ul class="alternate" type="square"> 
      <li>The DAS manages all the data of all nodes.</li> 
      <li>It sends out this data to the instances using some synchronization<br> mechanism.<br> What will be different in GF V3.1 is:</li> 
      <li>There will be no Node Agent at first. The main functionality of the<br> node agent was to start and stop remote instances. This can be done by<br> the OS's facilities.<br> Some of the reasons of the changes are:</li> 
      <li>The node agent was basically duplicating the OS's services functionality.</li> 
      <li>The were scalability issues in GFv2.x where the DAS was suffering when<br> many nodes started to synchronise.</li> 
      <li>A rewrite of the related code is required anyway because the way the<br> domain.xml information is handled has changed radically in GF V3 anyway.</li> 
      <li>There were also issues because the code that was running in the<br> cluster and non-cluster cases was different.<br> One thing that needs to be investigated (tried out) is whether and how<br> much optimizations are required for the synchronization process between<br> nodes and DAS. For example, Ericsson used 40 instances on different<br> machines.<br> How to do the synchronization is still being considered. Using a<br> database or SVN repository is a bad idea because of performance issues<br> and SVN is not Java-only. Mature rsync implementations in Java do not<br> seem available.<br> There will be two timings of synchronization:<br> 1.<br> When an instance starts. This could even be done just before the<br> instance starts (from the asadmin command that starts the instance, as<br> it has all the infrastructure to connect to the DAS anyway), instead of<br> from the VM process of the starting instance.<br> 2.<br> When operations are done on the DAS, which need to be propagated to the<br> instances. The DAS could have a global unique incrementing number<br> counting its state changes, so this number can be compared with the<br> remote instances's numbers to quickly see if they are up to date.<br> (Currently the plan is to use the timestamp of the DAS's domain.xml for<br> this).<br> In case of an instance restart, 1. could be skipped. The window of the<br> restart is short, so no need to sync everything again?<br> Two things that need to be taken care with is:</li> 
      <li>What should happen if a user tries to run an asadmin command on the<br> DAS while the DAS is sync'ing its state with remote nodes? Queue the<br> command? Does that mean the command won't come back until the command is<br> completed? What if the synchronization brings down the DAS, how will the<br> user know whether the command has been executed or not?</li> 
      <li>The DAS will propagate state changes to the remote instance. What if<br> an instance is starting but not yet ready to accept the DAS's commands?<br> How does the DAS know?<br> -&gt; Maybe we can make use of GMS here.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Second topic was about the issue Markus recently brought up.<br> Our understanding is that according to Markus (external contributor),<br> "real" Windows applications don't use batch files. Starting GlassFish<br> from the Start Menu makes a command prompt come up briefly, which looks<br> very clunky.<br> See: <a href="https://github.com/javaee/glassfish/issues/6784">https://github.com/javaee/glassfish/issues/6784</a><br> There are other OSS that use batch files (like Maven), but that is no<br> excuse for GlassFish if that is not the proper way.<br> More importantly, when starting GlassFish from the Start Menu it should<br> pop up a window. Depending on the functionality the GlassFish installer<br> offers, we should try using a Short-Cut that uses 'javaw.exe' to start<br> GlassFish to prevent the window popping up.<br> On Windows 7 there might be other issues (privileges on executables).<br> Furthermore, depending on Windows' (standard) ability of executing jar<br> files (as they're mapped to java -jar) would lead to complaints from<br> people who have mapped jar files to their zip utility.
