     <ol> 
      <li>No container repackaging. Foreign containers (such as the ones we do not ship by default with GlassFish) should not require a special file layout or even existence in specific directories in order to be pluggable in V3.</li> 
      <li>Container classes should not be loaded until an application making use of that container is deployed.</li> 
      <li>Containers may need other container to work successfully, forming a hierarchy of containers. It should be possible for containers to query the Glassfish v3 runtime to get information about installed containers.</li> 
      <li>Deployment or server startup code should be mainly the same and differ only with a few identified steps.</li> 
     </ol> <h4><a name="ContainerSPI-ContainerStartup"></a>Container Startup</h2> <h4><a name="ContainerSPI-Archive"></a>Archive</h3> <p>An archive type is an abstraction of the archive file format. An archive type can be implemented as a plain jar file or as a directory for instance. So far, GlassFish recognize only 2 types of archives, jar based and directory based. There are two sub intefaces to the Archive interface called the ReadableArchive and the WritableArchive. Implementations of the Archive interface are likely to no exist as it defines only the common protocol between ReadableArchive and WritableArchive. Providers of new archive type should write implementations of the ReadableArchive and the WritableArchive or an implementation that implements both interfaces.</p> <h4><a name="ContainerSPI-AchiveHandler"></a>AchiveHandler</h3> <p>An archive handler is responsible for handling a particular layout of an archive. Java EE defines a set of layout of archives like WAR, JAR or RAR for instance. Each layout should have one handler associated with it. There is no extension point supported at this level, the handler responsibility is to give access to the classes and resources packaged in the archive and should not contain any container specific code. The ClassLoader returned by the handler will be used by all the containers in which the application will eventually end up being deployed.</p>

Sniffer code must be as small as possible and must not load any of the container's runtime classes. </p> <p>Sniffer code can be installed in the glassfish v3 lib directory and since they implement the @Contract Sniffer interface, they will be automatically discovered by GlassFish v3. Hence there is no need to provide GlassFish v3 with a list of sniffers. Sniffers can be installed while GlassFish v3 is running and will be picked up at the next deployment request. </p> <p>In a future build of V3, we might consider a "special" remote repository that Sun would maintain on dev.java.net for instance where the runtime could go and download new Sniffers automatically (or through an administrative request)</p>

Since the container is not necessarily installed locally until the Sniffer.setUp() has been called, it is important that such modules are not loaded/resolved by HK2 until the setUp() has successfully finished.</p> <p>Connector modules are normal HK2 modules, they can have an ImportPolicy, LifecyclePolicy implementations to manage their list of imports and be notified when they are being loaded/stopped. They must however provide a least one HK2 component, annotated with the @Container annotation. </p> <p>This class is the container interface class, it does not implement a particular interface or subclass anything it is just a normal HK2 component : </p>

     </div> <p>Deployer.prepare() will only be called once during Deployment of an application. Subsequent server startups will not call prepare(). </p> <p>ApplicationContainer subclasses as provided by the implementation of the load() method is the interface to start/stop individual applications. Sub subclasses can also implement to Adapter interface to be automatically bound to the grizzly runtime for incoming web request. They can alternatively manage their binding to grizzly or to any other network interface layer. </p> <h4><a name="ContainerSPI-Subsequentdeployment"></a>Subsequent deployment</h2> <p>When other request for deployment are received by the GlassFish runtime, a simpler version of the container enablement is ran by GlassFish v3. </p> 
     <ol> 
      <li>The sniffer implementations are used to determine to module type</li> 
      <li>Once a module type is obtained, GlassFish v3 will look for a running container with that module type. If not found, we switch to Container Enablement as explained earlier. If found the Sniffer setUp() is not called, instead GlassFish v3, will obtain the deployer directly from the running instance (the one annotated with @Container).</li> 
      <li>The Deployer interface is used to prepare and load the implementation.</li> 
     </ol> <h4><a name="ContainerSPI-Undeployment"></a>Undeployment</h2> <p>Undeployment is a rather simple operation, GlassFish v3 will retrieve the ApplicationContainer and Deployer instances used to deploy the artifact and do the following operations :</p> 
     <ol> 
      <li>If the ApplicationContainer implements the Adapter interface, GlassFish will unregister this adapter from the Grizzly runtime.</li> 
      <li>ApplicationContainer.stop() will be called</li> 
      <li>Deployer.unload() and Deployer.clean() will be then called</li> 
     </ol> <p>The main difference between ApplicationContainer.stop() and Deployer.unload() is that stop should only stop the application which mean unregisters it from any Client discoverable mechanisms and remove any instances of components (e.g. EJB instances) in the system. Deployer.unload() should also flush associated resources like the ClassLoader instance used to load the application and such.</p> <p>Once the number of application deployed in a container drops to zero, the container becomes elligible for shutdown. </p> <h4><a name="ContainerSPI-Containershutdown"></a>Container shutdown</h2> <p>Once a container is identified for shutdown, GlassFish v3 will invoke the following operations in order.</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Deployer and @Container instances will be destroyed (preDestroy called if PreDestroy is implemented).</li> 
      <li>Connector module is being stopped by the system (and if LifecyclePolicy is implemented, stop() will be called on the module's LifecyclePolicy).</li> 
      <li>Sniffer.tearDown() is called which should result in removing Repository instances from the system ModuleRegistry.</li> 
     </ul> <p>At that point, the garbage collection will remove all container's classes.</p>
