GlassFish V3 will address large, complex and mission critical deployments yet also scale down to simple, lightweight and reliable deployments. This requires a flexible architecture that enables enterprises, ISVs and OEMs to "pay for what they need". GlassFish will shed the "one size fits all" approach typically found with application servers available today. User classifications include: * OEMs - broad needs ranging from delivering core parts of GlassFish V3 in embedded devices such as network routers to bundling GlassFish V3 feature-rich capabilities as part of a larger enterprise solution. * ISVs - deploy to a platform the fits the requirements of the problem their product addresses. * ASPs - hosting providers and enterprises utilizing virtualization technologies want to offer web container services without the overhead of unnecessary containers. * Enterprises - drive down costs and complexity for simple deployments but require feature-rich capabilities for mission critical deployments. * Java developers - lightweight and productive development while leveraging scripting languages to either augment or replace existing applications while leveraging their existing expertise. * Native scripting language developers - The Java community has been broadening its base to include the needs of scripting developers. Native GlassFish support of scripting languages provides a high-performance, multi-threaded deployment platform and offers the benefits of the broader Java ecosystem including tools, new business opportunities, etc. </td>

With native scripting support, JRuby and PHP developers will benefit from many of the production features such as clustering for scalability, high performance the overall reliability and manageability of GlassFish V3.

GlassFish V2 is the delivery vehicle for the Java EE 5 Reference Implemntation and GlassFish V3 will be the delivery vehicle for the Java EE 6 Reference Implementation. GlassFish V3 modularity and extensibility theme is a natural fit for Java EE 6 extensibility and profile goals.

This includes implementation improvements (such as efficient handling of large attachments) as well as documentation and samples improvements. Several new features are planned as well, such as full integration of WS-Addressing, WS-Policy support in JAX-WS, and Kerberos support. GlassFish will also continue alignment with JBI and Open ESB by providing the facilities required to deliver integration of web services and enterprise resources for loosely coupled enterprise applications. </td>

Ease of use applies equally for rapid round trip development by a single developer and for a large multi-administrator, multi-cluster enterprise development. For example, developers should not be required to log into the administration console or be required to use the CLI while enterprises require secure administration and command-line scripting capabilities. The following describes the areas of requirements for this theme:</p>

The installer should minimize steps and configuration options through the use of sensible defaults. Closely aligned to installation is ease of upgrade. The application server should be easy to upgrade to from GlassFish V2, and provide the framework for ease-of-upgrade to GlassFish V3.next. </td>

For example, developers should not be burdened with the complexity of clusters. Production operators should not be presented with the details of cluster configuration. Enterprises should be able to easily configure roles to fit their governance standards. Errors codes should uniquely define a potential issue with easy access to steps for resolution (or tips). </td>
