     </div> <h4><a name="GMSDiscoveryRegistrationService-DiscoveryServiceOptions"></a>Discovery Service Options</h2> <p>The goal of the service is to act a map of groups to masters. The group is described by a group name and namespace, and the returned data contains information about the GMS member including its location (IP address, port, protocol). When an instance is started, it checks with the discovery service to see if there is already a master for the group. If not, this member puts its own information into the service and becomes group master. When another instance comes up, it will retrieve the master's location and connect to the group.</p> <p>We currently have two options for this service: <br class="atl-forced-newline"></p> 
     <ol> 
      <li>Our own REST-based service, which will need to live at a WKA</li> 
      <li>Amazon S3, which can be used anywhere that is web-accessible (does not have to be used within AWS, but it would be cheaper that way as I understand it)</li> 
     </ol> <p>In either case, the bulk of GMS code will not need to know how the master information is stored. That logic is kept in a simple SPI used by the GMS runtime. However, there will be some slightly different requirements for the user as discussed below.</p> <h4><a name="GMSDiscoveryRegistrationService-GFRESTDiscoveryService"></a>GF REST Discovery Service</h3> <p>The service is implemented as a RESTful web service running in a GlassFish instance. The actual implementation of the service can change (currently a Java web app using Jersey and requiring a full Java EE container), but the REST interface defined should not change.</p> <p>It is expected that there is at least one instance of the service running, and later we may implement replication of data so that more than one instance can be used. To the GMS code, the instance is simply defined by a URI. The URI(s) of the discovery services are the only well known addresses that we need. An implementation of the service could be running anywhere that is accessible through HTTP; it doesn't have to be in the same environment as the GMS group.</p> <p><b>TBD:</b> <br class="atl-forced-newline"></p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Where this service will live within an installation. It could be a standalone process, but it would nice if there is some existing process that this code could live in.</li> 
      <li>Currently we have no security built into the REST service. This is a TODO for later.</li> 
      <li>Replication from one instance of service to another (GMS already accepts more than one service URI to handle this case).</li> 
     </ul> <p><b>User Requirements:</b> <br class="atl-forced-newline"></p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Service must be deployed at a well-known address.</li> 
      <li>Location of the service is set in the GMS_DISCOVERY_REGISTRY_URI_LIST cluster property</li> 
     </ul> <h4><a name="GMSDiscoveryRegistrationService-AmazonS3asDiscoveryService"></a>Amazon S3 as Discovery Service</h3> <p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> is storage that is available to a machine anywhere on the internet. It's a fee-based service, though <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/#pricing" title="S3 Pricing">prices would be cheap</a> for the amount of traffic that GMS would generate. The service operates as a RESTful and non-REST web service, and there is a client library already for accessing it. Information is stored in "buckets," and each bucket is defined by a name that is unique within S3. The GMS runtime, a client to the discovery service, shouldn't care whether the service is our own home-grown one or Amazon S3. But there may be some changes we need to make based on the limitations of S3. For instance, it is "eventually consistent," so we may need to poll for changes after setting a master for a group. For more on the data consistency of S3, see <a href="http://awsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/S3/latest/s3-dg.pdf" title="S3 Developer Guide">the developer guide</a> starting with page 9.</p> <p><b>TBD:</b></p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>How to write a Jersey client to call to S3. The alternative would be to use the Amazon 3rd party library.</li> 
      <li>How to handle the "eventually consistent" data model. A solution to this, such as having group masters periodically poll the service and take some action to resign as master, could solve other split-group issues as well.</li> 
     </ul> <p><b>User Requirements:</b></p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Location of S3 service can be included in the GMS_DISCOVERY_REGISTRY_URI_LIST property, signalling that GMS should use S3 for master discovery.</li> 
      <li>We will need to either generate an S3 bucket name or let the user supply one.</li> 
      <li>Security is already built into S3, but we need a way for a user to specify the access information for that account.</li> 
     </ul> <h4><a name="GMSDiscoveryRegistrationService-TheClient"></a>The Client</h3> <p>In this discussion, any GMS member is a client to the discovery service. See <a href="GMS3.2OnePager.html" title="GMS3.2OnePager">the one pager</a> for more information on what a member does with the information. As to how a member uses the service, a client has been written that abstracts away the actual client-server protocol. The current client we use is:</p>
