	Version 8 - 07/16/2012
	Bill Shannon


This note describes our general rules for choosing Maven, OSGi,
and jar file manifest names and version numbers for implementation
artifacts related to Java standard technologies.  Not all Java
standards will produce all artifacts described here, but if they do
they should use the approach described here.  These are the rules
that the spec lead for a Java specification should follow for the
reference implementation; compatible implementations will use
different names.

A given technology will commonly produce two artifacts:

- an API jar file

	The API jar file typically includes only the JCP-defined
	classes/interfaces/etc. that define the API, that is,
	usually just the javax.* class files.  The purpose of the
	API jar file is *only* to allow programs to be compiled
	against the API without the risk of depending on non-API
	classes.  The API jar file is *not* intended to be used
	at runtime (although in some cases it may be), and it is
	*not* intended to be a portable implementation of the API
	classes that can be used by others to derive their own
	implementation of the specification (although in some cases
	it will be).

	An extreme example of an API jar file is the "javaee.jar"
	file that we produce, which contains *no* code at all for
	any of the classes, and is not a valid class file for use
	at runtime.  It is suitable only for reference by the compiler.
	Most other API jar files will not take this extreme approach.

	We strongly encourage API jar files to be published to the Maven
	central repository.  To that end, the API jar file must be
	accompanied by two additional jar files:

        The API javadoc jar

          This is a jar file containing the generated documentation for
          the spec.  The index.html file of the javadoc tree must be at
          the top level of this jar file.

        The API source jar

          For debugging purposes, this is the source from which the API
          jar file was compiled.  It need not be compilable on its own.

- an implementation jar file

	If the Java specification defines a standalone version of the
	technology, the implementation jar file will be such a
	standalone implementation of the specification, and will meet
	all the compatibility requirements of the specification.  The
	implementation jar file typically includes all the classes from
	the API jar file, plus whatever implementation classes are needed
	to produce a complete runtime.

	In some cases the implementation jar file might contain only
	the implementation artifacts, and depend on the API jar file
	for the API definitions, although this is discouraged for
	standalone implementations.

	Not all specifications will define a standalone version, and
	even when they do a standalone version following the
	recommendations described here might not be available.
	For example, while the Servlet spec allows for a standalone
	implementation, we do not produce a standalone Servlet
	implementation packaged as a single jar file.  There might
	still be a standalone Servlet implementation, e.g., composed
	of multiple jar files, but we don't define naming or packaging
	for that here.


- Naming

To illustrate the general approach, we'll use three existing technologies:

- Connectors, a technology only available as a part of GlassFish
- JSF, a technology closely associated with GlassFish, but available
  independently
- JavaMail, a technology included with GlassFish, but widely used
  independently

The general approach is described using the following "variables":

API_PACKAGE	- the primary Java package defining the API
IMPL_NAMESPACE	- the primary Java package or namespace used by
		  the implementation of the API, or with which the
		  implementation of the API is associated
STANDALONE_IMPL	- a boolean indicating whether a standalone implementation
		  is available; if false, no implementation jar file is
		  defined

Given these variables, the following names should be used:

API jar file:			${API_PACKAGE}-api.jar
  OSGi Bundle-SymbolicName:	${API_PACKAGE}-api
  Maven group ID, artifact ID:	${API_PACKAGE}:${API_PACKAGE}-api
  jar Extension-Name:		${API_PACKAGE}
  API javadoc jar file:         ${API_PACKAGE}-api-javadoc.jar
  API source jar file:          ${API_PACKAGE}-api-sources.jar

Implementation jar file:	${API_PACKAGE}.jar
  OSGi Bundle-SymbolicName:	${IMPL_NAMESPACE}.${API_PACKAGE}
  Maven group ID, artifact ID:	${IMPL_NAMESPACE}:${API_PACKAGE}
  jar Extension-Name:		${API_PACKAGE}

These names are appropriate for the reference implementation of a
specification.  Compatible implementations should create an
implementation jar file named ${IMPL_NAMESPACE}.${API_PACKAGE}.jar.
Compatible implementations should not produce an API jar file.


The jar file names above are the names that should be used for jar files
that are made available in a download bundle, such as a zip file
distribution for the technology.  Note that, when building with Maven,
the jar file names will include the version number, as described in
the following section.

Note that the above would produce both an API jar and an implementation
jar with the same jar Extension-Name.  In the case where an implementation
jar file depends on the API jar file (rather than including the API
definitions), the API jar file should *not* have an Extension-Name header.

Note that even though the API jar file is not usable at runtime, it
should have OSGi metadata to allow it to be used by development tools
that understand OSGi bundles.


Applying these rules to our three examples, we get:

Connectors:

    API_PACKAGE=javax.resource
    IMPL_NAMESPACE=org.glassfish
    STANDALONE_IMPL=false

	API jar file:			javax.resource-api.jar
	  OSGi Bundle-SymbolicName:	javax.resource-api
	  Maven group ID, artifact ID:	javax.resource:javax.resource-api
	  jar Extension-Name:		javax.resource
         API javadoc jar file:          javax.resource-api-javadoc.jar
         API source jar file:           javax.resource-api-sources.jar

JSF:

    API_PACKAGE=javax.faces
    IMPL_NAMESPACE=org.glassfish
    STANDALONE_IMPL=true

	API jar file:			javax.faces-api.jar
	  OSGi Bundle-SymbolicName:	javax.faces-api
	  Maven group ID, artifact ID:	javax.faces:javax.faces-api
	  jar Extension-Name:		javax.faces
          API javadoc jar file:         javax.faces-api-javadoc.jar
          API source jar file:          javax.faces-api-sources.jar

	Implementation jar file:	javax.faces.jar
	  OSGi Bundle-SymbolicName:	org.glassfish.javax.faces
	  Maven group ID, artifact ID:	org.glassfish:javax.faces
	  jar Extension-Name:		javax.faces

JavaMail:

    API_PACKAGE=javax.mail
    IMPL_NAMESPACE=com.sun.mail
    STANDALONE_IMPL=true

	API jar file:			javax.mail-api.jar
	  OSGi Bundle-SymbolicName:	javax.mail-api
	  Maven group ID, artifact ID:	javax.mail:javax.mail-api
	  jar Extension-Name:		javax.mail
          API javadoc jar file:         javax.mail-api-javadoc.jar
          API source jar file:          javax.mail-api-sources.jar

	Implementation jar file:	javax.mail.jar
	  OSGi Bundle-SymbolicName:	com.sun.mail.javax.mail
	  Maven group ID, artifact ID:	com.sun.mail:javax.mail
	  jar Extension-Name:		javax.mail


For technologies that are closely associated with GlassFish,
the org.glassfish name should be used as IMPL_NAMESPACE.
For technologies that are more independent of GlassFish, a
name should be chosen based on the Java packages used for
the implementation, or the web site hosting the project.



- Version numbers

In addition to names, we also need to specify version numbers for
each of the artifacts produced.  The version numbers of the API
are specified through the JCP.  Two common approaches are used for
the version numbers of the implementation:

1. The implementation version tracks the API version, using a
   "dot-dot" version number to distinguish versions of the implementation
   that all implement the same API version.  This approach is most
   often used when the implementation is primarily intended to be only
   the reference implementation of the given technology.

2. The implementation version number is completely independent of the
   API version number.  This approach is most often used when the
   implementation has a purpose different from, or larger than, being
   just a reference implementation of a specification.  For example,
   The GlassFish version number is independent of the version numbers
   of any specification implemented by GlassFish.

A version number is a Dewey-decimal number of two or three components,
either &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt; or &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;micro&gt;.

We define the following additional variables:

SPEC_VERSION		- version number of the JCP specification,
			  always of the form &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;
SPEC_IMPL_VERSION	- version number of the API classes, derived from
			  SPEC_VERSION by adding an optional micro version
			  number
IMPL_VERSION		- version number of the implementation

Having a separate SPEC_VERSION and SPEC_IMPL_VERSION allows the API
definition classes to be updated (e.g., to fix spec or implementation
bugs) in cases where the corresponding spec has not changed.  In case
#1 above, SPEC_IMPL_VERSION and IMPL_VERSION will have the same value.
In case #2 above, SPEC_IMPL_VERSION will need to be maintained and
updated separately from IMPL_VERSION.

Adding the version number information to our general rules, we get:

API jar file:			${API_PACKAGE}-api.jar
  OSGi Bundle-SymbolicName:	${API_PACKAGE}-api
  OSGi bundle specversion:	${SPEC_VERSION}
  OSGi Bundle-Version:		${SPEC_IMPL_VERSION}
  Maven group ID, artifact ID:	${API_PACKAGE}:${API_PACKAGE}-api
  Maven version:		${SPEC_IMPL_VERSION}
  Maven API jar file:		${API_PACKAGE}-api-${SPEC_IMPL_VERSION}.jar
  jar Extension-Name:		${API_PACKAGE}
  jar Specification-Version:	${SPEC_VERSION}
  jar Implementation-Version:	${SPEC_IMPL_VERSION}

Implementation jar file:	${API_PACKAGE}.jar
  OSGi Bundle-SymbolicName:	${IMPL_NAMESPACE}.${API_PACKAGE}
  OSGi bundle specversion:	${SPEC_VERSION}
  OSGi Bundle-Version:		${IMPL_VERSION}
  Maven group ID, artifact ID:	${IMPL_NAMESPACE}:${API_PACKAGE}
  Maven version:		${IMPL_VERSION}
  Maven impl jar file:		${API_PACKAGE}-${IMPL_VERSION}.jar
  jar Extension-Name:		${API_PACKAGE}
  jar Specification-Version:	${SPEC_VERSION}
  jar Implementation-Version:	${IMPL_VERSION}


Note that Oracle is separately planning to submit a JSR to define
how versioning works for OSGi bundles corresponding to Java specifications.
A key part of that proposal is to use a "specversion" attribute to define
the specification version that a bundle implements or requires.  I've
used that approach above.  The proposed JSR will also define how the
Bundle-Version should be chosen; since that part of the proposed JSR
is less clear, I haven't tried to accommodate it above, although once
it's defined we should use it here.  It will likely require defining a
new "COMPAT_VERSION" variable to express the compatibility characteristics
of a bundle.

For technologies that are closely associated with GlassFish, and
especially for technologies that are built with the main GlassFish
workspace, the version number of the implementation should track
the version number of GlassFish.

Applying the above rules to our examples gives:

Connectors:

    API_PACKAGE=javax.resource
    IMPL_NAMESPACE=org.glassfish
    STANDALONE_IMPL=false
    SPEC_VERSION=1.6
    SPEC_IMPL_VERSION=1.6

	API jar file:			javax.resource-api.jar
	  OSGi Bundle-SymbolicName:	javax.resource-api
	  OSGi bundle specversion:	1.6
	  OSGi Bundle-Version:		1.6
	  Maven group ID, artifact ID:	javax.resource:javax.resource-api
	  Maven version:		1.6
	  Maven API jar file:		javax.resource-api-1.6.jar
	  jar Extension-Name:		javax.resource
	  jar Specification-Version:	1.6
	  jar Implementation-Version:	1.6

JSF:

    API_PACKAGE=javax.faces
    IMPL_NAMESPACE=org.glassfish
    STANDALONE_IMPL=true
    SPEC_VERSION=2.0
    SPEC_IMPL_VERSION=2.0
    IMPL_VERSION=2.0

	API jar file:			javax.faces-api.jar
	  OSGi Bundle-SymbolicName:	javax.faces-api
	  OSGi bundle specversion:	2.0
	  OSGi Bundle-Version:		2.0
	  Maven group ID, artifact ID:	javax.faces:javax.faces-api
	  Maven version:		2.0
	  Maven API jar file:		javax.faces-api-2.0.jar
	  jar Extension-Name:		javax.faces
	  jar Specification-Version:	2.0
	  jar Implementation-Version:	2.0

	Implementation jar file:	javax.faces.jar
	  OSGi Bundle-SymbolicName:	org.glassfish.javax.faces
	  OSGi bundle specversion:	2.0
	  OSGi Bundle-Version:		2.0
	  Maven group ID, artifact ID:	org.glassfish:javax.faces
	  Maven version:		2.0
	  Maven imp jar file:		javax.faces-2.0.jar
	  jar Extension-Name:		javax.faces
	  jar Specification-Version:	2.0
	  jar Implementation-Version:	2.0

JavaMail:

    API_PACKAGE=javax.mail
    IMPL_NAMESPACE=com.sun.mail
    STANDALONE_IMPL=true
    SPEC_VERSION=1.4
    SPEC_IMPL_VERSION=1.4.3
    IMPL_VERSION=1.4.3

	API jar file:			javax.mail-api.jar
	  OSGi Bundle-SymbolicName:	javax.mail-api
	  OSGi bundle specversion:	1.4
	  OSGi Bundle-Version:		1.4.3
	  Maven group ID, artifact ID:	javax.mail:javax.mail-api
	  Maven version:		1.4.3
	  Maven API jar file:		javax.mail-api-1.4.3.jar
	  jar Extension-Name:		javax.mail
	  jar Specification-Version:	1.4
	  jar Implementation-Version:	1.4.3

	Implementation jar file:	javax.mail.jar
	  OSGi Bundle-SymbolicName:	com.sun.mail.javax.mail
	  OSGi bundle specversion:	1.4
	  OSGi Bundle-Version:		1.4.3
	  Maven group ID, artifact ID:	com.sun.mail:javax.mail
	  Maven version:		1.4.3
	  Maven imp jar file:		javax.mail-1.4.3.jar
	  jar Extension-Name:		javax.mail
	  jar Specification-Version:	1.4
	  jar Implementation-Version:	1.4.3


Note that the Maven API jar file name contains the *implementation*
version number.  This allows the API definitions to be updated, e.g.,
to fix bugs, even though the API *specification* hasn't changed.




- Version numbers for non-final specifications

While a Java standard specification is under development, we need to
be able to publish artifacts corresponding to the non-final specification.
Maven version rules define a version number with a modifier as being
"less then", or older than a version number without a modifier.  This allows
us to use modifiers for these intermediate versions without confusion with
the final version number.  Ideally, the modifiers would correspond to the
JCP stages, but since modifiers sort lexicographically this won't work.
Unfortunately, this makes it difficult to determine (e.g.) which artifact
corresponds to the Proposed Final Draft version of the specification.

Unfortunately, OSGi defines modifiers as being "greater than" the base
version number, as does the jar extension spec.  This prevents us from
using modifiers in the same way as we would with Maven.  Instead, we
adopt a convention that a "micro" version number of "99" means a
non-final version of the following version number.

Some variables to define the new version numbers:

SPEC_BUILD		- the number of a particular build of the API jar file,
			  e.g., "01", "02", etc.
IMPL_BUILD		- the number of a particular build of the
			  implementation jar file, e.g., "01", "02", etc.
SPEC_VERSION		- version number of the last final JCP specification,
			  always of the form &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;
IMPL_VERSION		- version number of the previous final implementation
OSGI_IMPL_VERSION	- IMPL_VERSION truncated to &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;
NEW_SPEC_VERSION	- the version number of the specification under
			  development
NEW_IMPL_VERSION	- the version number of the implementation that
			  will be used when the implementation is final

This gives us the general rules for versioning a non-final artifact:

API jar file:			${API_PACKAGE}-api.jar
  OSGi Bundle-SymbolicName:	${API_PACKAGE}-api
  OSGi bundle specversion:	${SPEC_VERSION}.99.b${SPEC_BUILD}
  OSGi Bundle-Version:		${SPEC_VERSION}.99.b${SPEC_BUILD}
  Maven group ID, artifact ID:	${API_PACKAGE}:${API_PACKAGE}-api
  Maven version:		${NEW_SPEC_VERSION}-b${SPEC_BUILD}
  jar Extension-Name:		${API_PACKAGE}
  jar Specification-Version:	${SPEC_VERSION}.99.${SPEC_BUILD}
  jar Implementation-Version:	${NEW_SPEC_VERSION}-b${SPEC_BUILD}

Implementation jar file:	${API_PACKAGE}.jar
  OSGi Bundle-SymbolicName:	${IMPL_NAMESPACE}.${API_PACKAGE}
  OSGi bundle specversion:	${SPEC_VERSION}.99.b${SPEC_BUILD}
  OSGi Bundle-Version:		${OSGI_IMPL_VERSION}.99.b${IMPL_BUILD}
  Maven group ID, artifact ID:	${IMPL_NAMESPACE}:${API_PACKAGE}
  Maven version:		${NEW_IMPL_VERSION}-b${IMPL_BUILD}
  jar Extension-Name:		${API_PACKAGE}
  jar Specification-Version:	${SPEC_VERSION}.99.${SPEC_BUILD}
  jar Implementation-Version:	${NEW_IMPL_VERSION}-b${IMPL_BUILD}

- Dependencies

If the API definition of a given technology depends on the API of
another technology, the API jar file should represent that dependency.
Likewise, if the implementation of a given technology depends on the
API or implementation of another technology, the implementation jar
file should represent that dependency.  The dependency should be
represented using each of the relevant module technologies:

-- Maven dependencies

Maven dependencies should be represented in the pom.xml file for
the artifact that has the dependency.  API jar files should only
have dependencies on other API jar file artifacts.  Implementation
jar files should generally have dependencies on other implementation
jar file artifacts.  Note that such implementation dependencies
might include artifacts not defined by a JCP specification, such
as Apache Commons modules.

Because versions of JCP specifications are generally maintained to
be upwards compatible, a dependency on an API jar artifact should
include a version reference that specifies the minimum version of
the dependent technology, as defined by the specification, with no
maximum version number, e.g., "[1.6,)".

On the other hand, implementations often depend intimately on the
implementation details of dependent implementations.  The version
reference of a dependent implementation might be very specific or
open-ended.

-- OSGi dependencies

We strongly recommend the use of the OSGi Import-Package header to
specify dependencies.  The version references should be as described
above for Maven.

ISSUE:	We hope to provide more detailed recommendations for OSGi
	versioning in the future.

-- jar extension dependencies

The manifest of the API and implementation jar files should be used to
specify dependencies on other extensions, using the extension names
defined by this document.  The mechanism is defined by this document:
http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/extensions/
Note that specification version references always use a "greater than
or equal to" comparison.  An API jar should use only Specification-Version
references.  An implementation jar might also use Implementation-Vendor-Id
and Implementation-Version references.

While not defined here, we recommend that jar file manifests also include
the following attributes: Specification-Vendor, Implementation-Vendor,
and Implementation-Vendor-Id.

In addition to using the jar extension manifest headers to specify
dependencies, the jar Class-Path header should be used.  The simple
names of the dependent jar files (using the names specified by this
document) should be included in the Class-Path header.  The Class-Path
header of an API jar file should only include other API jar files.
The Class-Path header of an implementation jar file might include
other implementation jar files.


- Non-standalone implementations

For technologies that don't define a standalone implementation (e.g.,
Connectors), or for which no standalone implementation is produced
(e.g., Servlets), we don't define the naming, packaging, or versioning
of the implementation artifacts.  In general, we would expect the
implementation to follow the conventions of the larger project or
product in which it is embedded.  For example, the Connector and
Servlet implementation artifacts follow the conventions used by other
implementation artifacts that are part of GlassFish.


- Source code jar files

When licensing allows, we recommend that source code jar files be
published to the Maven repository using the Maven convention of:

  Maven API jar file:	${API_PACKAGE}-api-${SPEC_IMPL_VERSION}-sources.jar
  Maven imp jar file:	${API_PACKAGE}-${IMPL_VERSION}-sources.jar


- Special considerations for GlassFish

For technologies that are included in the GlassFish workspace,
it is sometimes necessary to separate the API definitions from
the API implementation, e.g., in order to avoid circular dependencies
between modules.  In such cases, separate API and implementation jar
files may be generated and delivered with GlassFish.  These artifacts
are not intended to be reused outside of GlassFish, and may have
artifact names and version numbers that are specific to GlassFish.

If a standalone version of these technologies is also made available,
it should follow the rules described in this document.  It might be
necessary to repackage the artifacts to do so.


- Transition

Many of our existing artifacts are not following the guidelines above.
Switching to these guidelines may disrupt users of current products
and thus doing so should be done carefully and with sufficient notification
to users.

For example, if version 1.4 of the JavaMail implementation was
previously available at http://download.java.net/maven/2/javax/mail,
and version 1.5 is published at
http://download.java.net/maven/2/com/sun/mail/javax/mail, users may
not notice that a new version is available, or may not be able to find
it easily.

During a transition period it may be reasonable to publish artifacts
using the existing conventions of the project, as well as publishing
new artifacts with the same content using the guidelines described here.

Alternatively, the Maven relocation feature described at
http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-relocation.html
may be used to redirect users to the new location for the artifacts.

How long the transition phase should be maintained can be different for
different projects, but generally should be measured in years, not
months. Note that it is permissible to publish artifacts to maven
central as long as sonatype's requirements are met.  The requirements
specified in this document are over and above what is required by
sonatype.


- Maven hints

If a Maven build is set up to produce an implementation jar file as
defined above (that includes both the API classes and the
implementation classes), an API jar file can be produced using a
pom.xml of the following form:

&lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
			    http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd"&gt;
    &lt;parent&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;${IMPL_NAMESPACE}&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;all&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;version&gt;${IMPL_VERSION}&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/parent&gt;
    &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;${API_PACKAGE}&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;${API_PACKAGE}-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;${SPEC_IMPL_VERSION}&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;packaging&gt;jar&lt;/packaging&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;${API_PACKAGE} API jar&lt;/name&gt;

    &lt;build&gt;
        &lt;plugins&gt;
	    &lt;plugin&gt;
		&lt;artifactId&gt;maven-dependency-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
		&lt;executions&gt;
		    &lt;execution&gt;
			&lt;id&gt;unpack&lt;/id&gt;
			&lt;phase&gt;process-sources&lt;/phase&gt;
			&lt;goals&gt;
			    &lt;goal&gt;unpack&lt;/goal&gt;
			&lt;/goals&gt;
		    &lt;/execution&gt;
		&lt;/executions&gt;
		&lt;configuration&gt;
		    &lt;artifactItems&gt;
			&lt;artifactItem&gt;
			    &lt;groupId&gt;${API_PACKAGE}&lt;/groupId&gt;
			    &lt;artifactId&gt;${API_PACKAGE}&lt;/artifactId&gt;
			    &lt;version&gt;${$IMPL_VERSION}&lt;/version&gt;
			&lt;/artifactItem&gt;
		    &lt;/artifactItems&gt;
		    &lt;outputDirectory&gt;
			${project.build.outputDirectory}
		    &lt;/outputDirectory&gt;
		    &lt;includes&gt;
			javax/**,
			META-INF/*
		    &lt;/includes&gt;
		&lt;/configuration&gt;
	    &lt;/plugin&gt;
	    &lt;plugin&gt;
		&lt;artifactId&gt;maven-jar-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
		&lt;configuration&gt;
		    &lt;finalName&gt;${project.artifactId}&lt;/finalName&gt;
		    &lt;archive&gt;
			&lt;manifestFile&gt;
			  ${project.build.outputDirectory}/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
			&lt;/manifestFile&gt;
		    &lt;/archive&gt;
		&lt;/configuration&gt;
	    &lt;/plugin&gt;
        &lt;/plugins&gt;
    &lt;/build&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
