    <td valign="top" class="pagebody">   <p>Summary: This draft presents a new type of event driven Servlets, with an associated filter pipeline, complementing the regular HttpServlet servlets. The idea is to use IO triggered events to allow a Servlet to perform reads and writes that will not block, in addition to other capabilities (including suspend/resume). Not overloading the service() method of regular servlets allows avoid causing compatibility problems with classic filters, as well as simpler code in the servlets (the event handling being done by a simple switch/case). Additional requests events (similar to ServletRequestListener), as well as new elements for declaring and mapping this new Servlet and Filter type could be defined, but are not mandatory (Servlet and Filter type identification is possible at runtime).</p> <p>The Servlet class implements the following:</p>

 * This interface should be implemented by Servlets which would like to handle
 * asynchronous IO, receiving events when data is available for reading, and
 * being able to output data without the need for being invoked by the container.
 * Note: When this interface is implemented, the service method of the Servlet will
 * never be called, and will be replaced with a begin event.

    /**
     * Enumeration describing the major events that the container can invoke 
     * the EventHttpServlet event() method with:
     * &lt;ul&gt;
     * &lt;li&gt;BEGIN - will be called at the beginning 
     *  of the processing of the connection. It can be used to initialize any relevant 
     *  fields using the request and response objects. Between the end of the processing 
     *  of this event, and the beginning of the processing of the end or error events,
     *  it is possible to use the response object to write data on the open connection.
     *  Note that the response object and dependent OutputStream and Writer are  
     *  not synchronized, so when they are accessed by multiple threads adequate
     *  synchronization is needed. After processing the initial event, the request 
     *  is considered to be committed.&lt;/li&gt;
     * &lt;li&gt;EOF - The end of file of the input has been reached, and no further data is
     *  available. This event is sent because it can be difficult to detect otherwise.
     *  Following the processing of this event and the processing of any subsequent
     *  event, the event will be suspended.&lt;/li&gt;
     * &lt;li&gt;END - End may be called to end the processing of the request. Fields that have
     *  been initialized in the begin method should be reset. After this event has
     *  been processed, the request and response objects, as well as all their dependent
     *  objects will be recycled and used to process other requests. In particular,
     *  this event will be called if the HTTP session associated with the connection
     *  times out, if the web application is reloaded, if the server is shutdown, or
     *  if the connection was closed asynchronously.&lt;/li&gt;
     * &lt;li&gt;ERROR - Error will be called by the container in the case where an IO exception
     *  or a similar unrecoverable error occurs on the connection. Fields that have
     *  been initialized in the begin method should be reset. After this event has
     *  been processed, the request and response objects, as well as all their dependent
     *  objects will be recycled and used to process other requests.&lt;/li&gt;
     * &lt;li&gt;EVENT - Event will be called by the container after the resume() method is called,
     *  during which any operations can be performed, including closing the connection
     *  using the close() method.&lt;/li&gt;
     * &lt;li&gt;READ - This indicates that input data is available, and that at least one 
     *  read can be made without blocking. The available and ready methods of the InputStream or
     *  Reader may be used to determine if there is a risk of blocking: the Servlet
     *  must continue reading while data is reported available. When encountering a read error, 
     *  the Servlet should report it by propagating the exception properly. Throwing 
     *  an exception will cause the error event to be invoked, and the connection 
     *  will be closed. 
     *  Alternately, it is also possible to catch any exception, perform clean up
     *  on any data structure the Servlet may be using, and using the close method
     *  of the event. It is not allowed to attempt reading data from the request 
     *  object outside of the processing of this event, unless the suspend() method
     *  has been used.&lt;/li&gt;
     * &lt;li&gt;TIMEOUT - the connection timed out, but the connection will not be closed unless 
     *  the servlet uses the close method of the event&lt;/li&gt;
     * &lt;li&gt;WRITE - Write is sent if the Servlet is using the ready method. This means that 
     *  the connection is ready to receive data to be written out. This event will never
     *  be received if the Servlet is not using the ready() method, or if the ready() 
     *  method always returns true.&lt;/li&gt;

     </div> <p>Of all things, the class and interface names are placeholders, as it did not seem appropriate to use the "Servlet" name unless it is part of one of the Servlet specifications.</p> <p>Servlets and filters are at the moment mapped along with regular filters and Servlets (separation between the two pipelines is done using the types; the event type gets precedence for Servlets - if a servlet implements both the regular and the event interface, then it will be used in event mode). New web.xml elements could be defined: &lt;event-servlet&gt;, &lt;event-servlet-mapping&gt;, &lt;event-filter&gt;, &lt;event-filter-mapping&gt;.</p> <p>If deemed useful, support for this Servlet type could be optional. Similarly, additional request events could be defined. Relationship with the request dispatcher is not clearly defined at his time (it is assumed that usage to dispatch to a regular Servlet is forbidden, but it should be possible to dispatch the event processing to another EventHttpServlet, identical to what is done for regular HttpServlet). Implementation could be difficult (it should require a mix of blocking and non blocking IO capabilities), but is currently feature complete in the JBoss Web 2.1+ project (<a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossweb/">http://www.jboss.org/jbossweb/</a>). This work is based on extending and simplifying the interface that has been designed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.x.</p> <p>Although this allows writing IO code that will not block (both reading and writing), this still exposes and supports the usual blocking IO constructs (all bytes written in a write(byte[]) call will be written or an exception will be sent; a read() is guaranteed to return at least one byte, or EOF will be returned or an exception will be thrown).</p> <p>Small code examples (demonstrating how to implement common patterns):</p>
