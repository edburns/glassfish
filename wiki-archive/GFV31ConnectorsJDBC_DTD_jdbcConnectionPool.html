    jdbc-connection-pool defines configuration used to create and     
    manage a pool physical database connections. Pool definition is   
    named, and can be referred to by multiple jdbc-resource elements  
    (See &lt;jdbc-resource&gt;).                                            

    Each named pool definition results in a pool instantiated at server        
    start-up. Pool is populated when accessed for the first time. If two or    
    more jdbc-resource elements point to the same jdbc-connection-pool         
    element, they are using the same pool of connections, at run time.

        Most JDBC 2.0 drivers permit use of standard property lists,  
        to specify User, Password and other resource configuration.   
        While these are optional properties, according to the         
        specification, several of these properties may be necessary   
        for most databases. See Section 5.3 of JDBC 2.0 Standard      
        Extension API.                                                

        The following are the names and corresponding values for these

            default name of the database user with which connections  
            will be stablished. Programmatic database authentication  
            or default-resource-principal specified in vendor         
            specific web and ejb deployment descriptors will take     
            precedence, over this default. The details and caveats    
            are described in detail in the Administrator's guide.

            used to name an underlying XADataSource, or               
            ConnectionPoolDataSource when pooling of connections is   
            done

            Textual Description                                       

        When one or more of these properties are specified, they are passed as 
        is using set&lt;Name&gt;(&lt;Value&gt;) methods to the vendors Datasource class    
        (specified in datasource-classname). User and Password properties are  
        used as default principal, if Container Managed authentication is      
        specified and a default-resource-principal is not found in application 
        deployment descriptors.                                                


  attributes 
    allow-non-component-callers                                                
        A pool with this property set to true, can be used by         
        non-J2EE components (i.e components other than EJBs or        
        Servlets). The returned connection is enlisted automatically  
        with the transaction context obtained from the transaction    
        manager. This property is to enable the pool to be used by    
        non-component callers such as ServletFilters, Lifecycle       
        modules, and 3rd party persistence managers. Standard J2EE    
        components can continue to use such pools. Connections        
        obtained by non-component callers are not automatically       
        cleaned at the end of a transaction by the container. They    
        need to be explicitly closed by the the caller.               
    associate-with-thread                                                      
        Associate connection with a thread such that when the     
        same thread is in need of a connection, it can reuse the      
        connections already associated with that thread, thereby not   
        incurring the overhead of getting a connection from the pool. 
        Default value is false.
    connection-creation-retry-attempts                                         
        The number of attempts to create a new connection. Default is 
        0, which implies no retries.                                  
    connection-creation-retry-interval-in-seconds                              
        The time interval between retries while attempting to create  
        a connection. Default is 10 seconds. Effective when           
        connection-creation-retry-attempts is greater than 0.         
    connection-leak-reclaim                                                    
        If enabled, connection will be reusable (put back into pool)  
        after connection-leak-timeout-in-seconds occurs. Default      
        value is false.                                               
    connection-leak-timeout-in-seconds                                         
        To aid user in detecting potential connection leaks by the    
        application. When a connection is not returned back to the    
        pool by the application within the specified period, it is    
        assumed to be a potential leak and stack trace of the caller  
        will be logged. Default is 0, which implies there is no leak  
        detection, by default. A positive non-zero value turns on     
        leak detection. Note however that, this attribute only        
        detects if there is a connection leak. The connection can be  
        reclaimed only if connection-leak-reclaim is set to true.     
    connection-validation-method                                               
        specifies the type of validation to be performed when         
        is-connection-validation-required is true. Default value
        of this attribute is table. (see validation-table-name).The following      
        types of validation are supported:                            
        auto-commit                                                            
            using connection.autoCommit()                             
        meta-data                                                                    
            using connection.getMetaData()                            
        table                                                                  
            performing a query on a user specified table (see         
            validation-table-name).
        custom-validation
            validation based on user specified validation mechanism (see
            validation-classname).
    datasource-classname                                                       
        Name of the vendor supplied JDBC datasource resource manager. 
        An XA or global transactions capable datasource class will    
        implement javax.sql.XADatasource interface. Non XA or Local   
        transactions only datasources will implement                  
        javax.sql.Datasource interface.                  
    driver-classname
        Name of the vendor supplied JDBC driver class name. The 
        specified driver should implement the java.sql.Driver interface.
    fail-all-connections                                                       
        indicates if all connections in the pool must be closed       
        should a single validation check fail. The default is false.  
        One attempt will be made to re-establish failed connections.  
    idle-timeout-in-seconds                                                    
        maximum time in seconds, that a connection can remain idle in 
        the pool. After this time, the pool implementation can close  
        this connection. Note that this does not control connection   
        timeouts enforced at the database server side. Adminsitrators 
        are advised to keep this timeout shorter than the database    
        server side timeout (if such timeouts are configured on the   
        specific vendor's database), to prevent accumulation of       
        unusable connection in Application Server.                    
    init-sql
        Used to specify a SQL string by the user, to be executed 
        whenever a connection is created from the pool (not the 
        connections that are reused). This is executed to initialize
        the state of the connection.
        This is an optional attribute and should carry a value when 
        a initialization SQL is to be executed.
    is-connection-validation-required                                          
        if true, connections are validated (checked to find out if    
        they are usable) before giving out to the application. The    
        default is false.                                             
    is-isolation-level-guaranteed                                              
        Applicable only when a particular isolation level is          
        specified for transaction-isolation-level. The default value  
        is true. This assures that every time a connection is         
        obtained from the pool, it is guaranteed to have the          
        isolation set to the desired value. This could have some      
        performance impact on some JDBC drivers. Can be set to false  
        by that administrator whefln they are certain that the          
        application does not change the isolation level before        
        returning the connection.                      
    lazy-connection-association                                                
        Connections are lazily associated when an operation is        
        performed on them. Also, they are disassociated when the      
        transaction is completed and a component method ends, which   
        helps reuse of the physical connections. Default value is     
        false.                                                        
    lazy-connection-enlistment                                                 
        Enlist a resource to the transaction only when it is actually 
        used in a method, which avoids enlistment of connections that 
        are not used in a transaction. This also prevents unnecessary 
        enlistment of connections cached in the calling components.   
        Default value is false.                                       
    match-connections                                                          
        To switch on/off connection matching for the pool. It can be  
        set to false if the administrator knows that the connections  
        in the pool will always be homogeneous and hence a connection 
        picked from the pool need not be matched by the resource      
        adapter. Default value is false.                              
    max-connection-usage-count                                                 
        When specified, connections will be re-used by the pool for   
        the specified number of times after which it will be closed.  
        This is useful for instance, to avoid statement-leaks.        
        Default value is 0, which implies the feature is not enabled. 
    max-pool-size                                                              
        maximum number of conections that can be created              
    max-wait-time-in-millis                                                    
        amount of time the caller will wait before getting a          
        connection timeout. The default is 60 seconds. A value of 0   
        will force caller to wait indefinitely.                       
    name                                                                       
        unique name of the pool definition.                           
    non-transactional-connections                                              
        A pool with this property set to true returns                 
        non-transactional connections. This connection does not get   
        automatically enlisted with the transaction manager.     
    ping
        A pool with this attribute set to true is pinged during the pool
        creation or reconfiguration to identify and warn of any erroneous
        values for the its attributes. Default value of this attribute 
        is false.
    pool-resize-quantity                                                       
        number of connections to be removed when                      
        idle-timeout-in-seconds timer expires. Connections that have  
        idled for longer than the timeout are candidates for removal. 
        When the pool size reaches steady-pool-size, the connection   
        removal stops.                                                
    pooling
        When set to false, this attribute disables connection pooling. 
        Default value of this attribute is true.
    res-type                                                                   
        DataSource implementation class could implement one of of     
        javax.sql.DataSource, javax.sql.XADataSource or               
        javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource interfaces. To support 
        configuration of JDBC drivers and applications that use
        java.sql.Driver implementations, set this attribute to
        java.sql.Driver. This optional  attribute must be specified to 
        disambiguate when a Datasource class implements two or more 
        of these interfaces or when a driver classname is to be provided. An error is 
        produced when this attribute has a legal value and the        
        indicated interface is not implemented by the datasource      
        class. This attribute has no default value. (see also driver-classname).
     sql-trace-listeners
        Used to set if the SQL statements executed by applications need to be traced
        Aids administrators in analysing the statements. Multiple listeners can be
        specified as comma separated list of listener implementation class names.
     statement-cache-size
        Used to set the number of statements to be cached using the default 
        caching mechanism (Least Recently Used). Default value of 0 implies 
        the statement caching is not enabled.
|    statement-leak-reclaim
|       If enabled, statement is reclaimed after the statement-leak-timeout-
|       in-seconds occurs. Default value is false.
|    statement-leak-timeout-in-seconds                                               
|       To aid user in detecting the statement leaks by applications.
|       When a statement is not closed by the application within the specified
|       period, it is assumed to be a statement leak. Default is 0, which 
|       implies there is no statement leak detection. A 
|       positive non-zero value turns on statement leak detection.
|       Note however that, this attribute only detects if there is
|       a statement leak. The statement can be reclaimed only is
|       statement-leak-reclaim is set to true. Statement timeout
|       value set should be less than the Statement leak timeout.
|       Connection leak timeout (in seconds) value should be 
|       greater than Statement leak timeout, when connection leak
|       tracing is enabled.
    statement-timeout-in-seconds                                               
        Sets the timeout property of a connection to enable           
        termination of abnormally long running queries. Default value 
        of -1 implies that it is not enabled.                         
    steady-pool-size                                                           
        minimum and initial number of connections maintained in the   
        pool.                                                         
    transaction-isolation-level                                                
        Specifies the Transaction Isolation Level on the pooled       
        database connections. Optional. Has no default. If left       
        unspecified the pool operates with default isolation level    
        provided by the JDBC Driver. A desired isolation level can be 
        set using one of the standard transaction isolation levels,   
        which see.                                                    

        Applications that change the Isolation level on a pooled connection    
        programmatically, risk polluting the pool and this could lead to       
        program errors. Also see: is-isolation-level-guaranteed                

    validate-atmost-once-period-in-seconds                                     
        Used to set the time-interval within which a connection is    
        validated atmost once. Default is 0 which implies that it is  
        not enabled. TBD: Documentation is to be corrected.           
    validation-classname
        Used to set the custom validation implementation class name
        implemented by the user. This parameter is mandatory if the
        connection-validation-type is set to custom-validation. The class
        name provided must be accessible to the application server.
    validation-table-name                                                      
        specifies the table name to be used to perform a query to     
        validate a connection. This parameter is mandatory, if        
        is-connection-validation-required is set to true and
        connection-validation-type set to table. Verification by      
        accessing a user specified table may become necessary for     
        connection validation, particularly if database driver caches 
        calls to setAutoCommit() and getMetaData().                   
    wrap-jdbc-objects                                                          
        When set to true, application will get wrapped jdbc objects   
        for Statement, PreparedStatement, CallableStatement,          
        ResultSet, DatabaseMetaData. Defaults to true.

  Used in:
