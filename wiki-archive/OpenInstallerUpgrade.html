2. Project Summary


   2.1. Project Description:

   This project introduces a simple mechanism to upgrade software from one
   release to another in the openInstaller framework. With the addition of
   this feature, products using openInstaller framework for their installation
   can offer their customers a straightforward way of upgrading
   software on their systems.

   2.2. Risks and Assumptions:

   Previous versions of products can accurately be described using the same
   syntax as current versions

3. Context and Need Summary
   3.1. Problem Area:
       One of the many critical (and desired) features of an installer
       is the ability to detect a previously installed version
       of the software and be able to upgrade if necessary.  Without support
       for upgrade, products using openInstaller framework would not be
       able to provide a means for the customers to upgrade software to
       its latest and greatest versions which is not only a bad user
       experience but also a major inconvenience to the users.

   3.2. Consumer/Requester:
       The Message Queue project has requested this functionality
       (WSARC/2006/536).

   3.3. Justification:
       Specifically, Message Queue has a varied set of installed versions,
       as it ships with Solaris, and with Java ES, as well as having its
       own standalone downloadable distribution.  With such a wide variety
       of legacy versions, it is difficult to provide straightforward
       documentation on how to upgrade manually.  Therefore, a "one-click"
       solution is desired.

   3.4. How will you know when you are done?:
       When it is possible to describe previous (legacy) versions of
       products using the interfaces proposed by this project, and have
       those legacy versions be detected and upgraded automatically by
       the openInstaller framework.

4. Technical Description:
   4.1. Details:

    Section 3.7 of the main design document for LSARC 2007/095 describes the
    openInstaller installation behavior. This behavior is summarized by
    describing the 5 top-level steps taken to install:

    1) Create internal representation of existing, installed software
    2) Create internal representation of software available on media
    3) Ask user what they want to do (e.g. install, or remove, select products)
    4) Modify representation from 2) to reflect user's choices
    5) Generate linear set of operations to go from 1) to 4)

    This project introduces the required logic to be added to the install
    engine in step 5) to deal with upgrade (the astute reader will notice
    in the document referenced from 2007/095, that "Upgrade" is mentioned,
    but is not implemented).  This project implements that logic.

    Upgrade support in openInstaller framework essentially consists of
    two steps:

    * Detection of pre-existing software (step (1) above)
    * Generation of Upgrade operations (step (5) above).

    4.1.1 Detection of pre-existing software

    For software that has previously been installed using openInstaller, the
    SIMS (LSARC 2007/097 Software Inventory Management System) is
    consulted.  This component registers all software that has been installed
    through openInstaller and is described in detail in the aforementioned
    LSARC case.  The internal representation of installed software needed
    in step (1) above is taken from SIMS directly.

    Software that has been installed, but not with openInstaller, is
    termed "legacy" software for the purposes of this project.

    To detect installed products that have not been installed by
    openInstaller, the framework relies on a set of descriptors called
    "legacy descriptors" for each of the products that need to be detected.
    The legacy descriptors conform to the existing schema that products
    use to describe their *current* versions of products.

    Each "legacy" descriptor represents a previous version of a product.
    The descriptor is written as though the developer was writing it for
    that version of the product at a previous point in time (in most
    cases, a developer and cut/paste from the current dependency
    descriptor for their product, and change the versions and/or
    package names).  Additional attributes and elements have been added
    to the dependency schema to support certain features for upgrade.

    These legacy descriptors are used by the openInstaller engine to
    detect the presence of previous versions of the product(s) during
    the step (1) above.  If one or more previous versions of the product
    are detected, then they are temporarily registered into the SIMS
    database, such that the logic that generates upgrade operations can
    always rely on SIMS to give it the current state of the system, which
    consists of software installed via openInstaller, and software that was
    not.  The registration of legacy software into SIMS is *not* persistant
    (e.g. no new metapackages are created when legacy software is detected).
    When the install engine quits (e.g. if the user selects "Cancel" before
    actually performing the upgrade), the results of the detection are
    thrown away.

    4.1.2 Support for legacy descriptors

    As mentioned in the previous section, some additional attributes and
    elements have been added to the generic openInstaller dependency
    descriptor schema to support the creation of legacy descriptors.

  - "critical" attribute:
      The critical element of the component schema serves to define certain
      Realizations as critical for the normal functioning of the Operating
      system. Realizations that are critical will not be remov
2000
ed during
      uninstallation. So shared components that are crucial for the operation
      of the OS itself can be declared critical in the descriptor.

  - "KeyItems" element
      For detection of previous versions of software that were NOT installed
      using standard packaging formats (e.g. SVR4, RPM).  This allows
      openInstaller to detect previous versions of products by looking
      for specific files on the filesystem (Relative to an install home),
      or specific entries in the system's generic regisry (e.g. Windows
      Registry).

  - "Version" attribute on InstallableUnit
      Certain Sun products increment SUNW_PRODVERS on Solaris (and the RPM
      "Release" field on Linux) when patches are applied (since their
      policy dictates that the standard versioning attribute (e.g. VERSION
      on Solaris) must remain the same over the lifecycle of a given
      release).  In this case, openInstaller needs to know what the
      "special" version string should be on these patched products, such
      that a proper version can be displayed to the end user.  This
      attribute allows legacy descriptors to declare the version that
      should be present in these non-traditional fields of packages for
      legacy versions of products.

  - "Version" attribute on Realization
      This attribute serves the exact same purpose as the above
      InstallableUnit attribute, except declaring it at this level
      applies it to all enclosed InstallableUnits (in other words,
      a developer convenience).

    4.1.2 Generation of upgrade operations

    A simple modification of the logic detailed in section 3.7.3 of
    the case materials for 2007/095 is delivered by this project.
    Speifically, when generating operations to go from state A to B, when
    a situation is encountered where a product is desired to be installed,
    but a previous version is already installed, the operations generated
    will be to first remove the installed, legacy software (by generating
    removal operations based on the legacy descriptor's description of the
    legacy version of the software, as though the user chose to uninstall),
    followed by the installation of the newer version.

    Note that only those products which are at earlier versions are upgraded.
    For example, for a product that consists of A, B, and C, if B and C are
    at (or above) the versions shipped with the installer, but A is below
    the version of A shipped with the product, then only A will be upgraded.

    4.1.3 User Interface

    ** Interactive modes (GUI/CUI):

    A new screen is delivered by this project which presents the results
    of the legacy detection, and offers the user a preview of what will
    be done.  An example mockup is below:

    ---------------------------------------
    The following components were detected on this system
    and will be upgraded to the version in (parantheses):

    Foo Product 4.5 (5.0)
    Bar Product 1.0 (1.1)

    The following components were detected on this system and will remain
    at their installed versions:

    Baz Product 1.0 FCS
    --------------------------------------

    In the case that one or more products will be upgraded, the user
    is forced to agree to this by selecting a specific choice on the
    upgrade user interface (thereby avoiding destructive operations
    by accidentially clicking through).

    ** Silent mode:

    By default, openInstaller will refuse to upgrade a product when
    one or more of the products that require upgrade are marked "Critical".
    This is to avoid potential catastrophe.  If the user so chooses,
    a silent (scripted) upgrade can be forced by setting the following
    attribute to "true":

    Upgrade.upgrade.ALLOW_UPGRADE

   4.1.3 Media Layout

   The install developer is expected to place legacy descriptors in
   a sub-directory below the main dependency descriptor directory as
   defined in section 5.3 of the case materials for 2007/095.
   Each subdirectory must contain the legacy descriptors for one
   legacy version of a product.

   For example:

   [MEDIA]/dependency         &lt;---- lists the files/descriptors in this version
             MessageQueue.xml
             JDK.xml
             NSPR.xml
             NSPRD.xml
             NSS.xml
             oldVer1/             &lt;---- directory for VersionA descriptors
               MessageQueue.xml
               JDK.xml
               NSPR.xml
               NSPRD.xml
               NSS.xml

Where [MEDIA] is the top-level Media-Location directory defined in 2007/095,
and the "oldVer1" contains the descriptors for an older version of this
product.  The name of the folder is not important (all subdirectories are
scanned for legacy descriptors, and used during detection).
